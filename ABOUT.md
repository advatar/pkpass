Dynamic rules driven auction system
WO 2001039095 A2
ABSTRACT
A dynamic rules driven auction system allows for flexible parameters for online auctions. This is accomplished by providing a rules engine, which handles rules written embedded in objects. The rules for each auction have unlimited flexibility, and may be written by the seller, or by a third party. The rules engine allows for this flexibility by receiving one or more objects from a database located on a server associated with a seller where the one or more objects contains one or more rules defining the parameters of the online auction. The objects are loaded into a rules engine located on the server, parsed to determine the rules; and then the rules are implemented using the rules engine while executing the online auction. The execution of the on line auction produces results, which are then forwarded to the database or to the seller.
